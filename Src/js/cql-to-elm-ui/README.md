# CQL-to-ELM UI

A front end for the Kotlin/JS-based CQL compiler.

## Local development

Build the CQL compiler locally by running the `:cql-to-elm:build` task in the `../../java` project.
This will output the cql-all-cql-to-elm package to the `../../java/build/js/packages` directory.

To then run this project locally:

    npm install
    npm run dev
