 Embedded class
@class MedicationPrescriptionDispenseComponent
@exports  MedicationPrescriptionDispenseComponent as MedicationPrescriptionDispenseComponent
###
class MedicationPrescriptionDispenseComponent extends Element
  constructor: (@json) ->
    super(@json)
  ###*
  Identifies the medication that is to be dispensed.  This may be a more specifically defined than the medicationPrescription.medication . This is either a link to a resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of medications.
  @returns {Reference}
  ###
  medication: -> if @json['medication'] then new Reference(@json['medication'])
  
  ###*
  Design Comments: This indicates the validity period of a prescription (stale dating the Prescription) 
It reflects the prescriber perspective for the validity of the prescription. Dispenses must not be made against the prescription outside of this period. The lower-bound of the Dispensing Window signifies the earliest date that the prescription can be filled for the first time. If an upper-bound is not specified then the Prescription is open-ended or will default to a stale-date based on regulations. 
Rationale: Indicates when the Prescription becomes valid, and when it ceases to be a dispensable Prescription.
  @returns {Period}
  ###
  validityPeriod: -> if @json['validityPeriod'] then new Period(@json['validityPeriod'])
  
  ###*
  An integer indicating the number of repeats of the Dispense. 
UsageNotes: For example, the number of times the prescribed quantity is to be supplied including the initial standard fill.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Number} objects
  ###
  numberOfRepeatsAllowed:-> @json['numberOfRepeatsAllowed']
  
  ###*
  The amount that is to be dispensed.
  @returns {Quantity}
  ###
  quantity: -> if @json['quantity'] then new Quantity(@json['quantity'])
  
  ###*
  Identifies the period time over which the supplied product is expected to be used, or the length of time the dispense is expected to last. 
In some situations, this attribute may be used instead of quantity to identify the amount supplied by how long it is expected to last, rather than the physical quantity issued, e.g. 90 days supply of medication (based on an ordered dosage) When possible, it is always better to specify quantity, as this tends to be more precise. expectedSupplyDuration will always be an estimate that can be influenced by external factors.
  @returns {Duration}
  ###
  expectedSupplyDuration: -> if @json['expectedSupplyDuration'] then new Duration(@json['expectedSupplyDuration'])

  External identifier - one that would be used by another non-FHIR system - for example a re-imbursement system might issue its own id for each prescription that is created.
