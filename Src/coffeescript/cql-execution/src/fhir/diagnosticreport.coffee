@class DiagnosticReportImageComponent
@exports  DiagnosticReportImageComponent as DiagnosticReportImageComponent
###
class DiagnosticReportImageComponent
  constructor: (@json) ->
    super(@json)
  ###*
  A comment about the image. Typically, this is used to provide an explanation for why the image is included, or to draw the viewer's attention to important features.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link String} objects
  ###
  comment:-> @json['comment']
  
  ###*
  Reference to the image source.
  @returns {Reference}
  ###
  link: -> if @json['link'] then new Reference(@json['link'])
  
###*
The findings and interpretation of diagnostic  tests performed on patients, groups of patients, devices, and locations, and/or specimens derived from these. The report includes clinical context such as requesting and provider information, and some mix of atomic results, images, textual and coded interpretation, and formatted representation of diagnostic reports.
@class DiagnosticReport
@exports DiagnosticReport as DiagnosticReport
###
class DiagnosticReport 
  constructor: (@json) ->
  ###*
  A code or name that describes this diagnostic report.
  @returns {CodeableConcept}
  ###
  name: -> if @json['name'] then new CodeableConcept(@json['name'])
  
  ###*
  The status of the diagnostic report as a whole.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link String} objects
  ###
  status:-> @json['status']
  
  ###*
  The date and/or time that this version of the report was released from the source diagnostic service.
  @returns {Date}
  ###
  issued: -> if @json['issued'] then new Date(@json['issued'])
  
  ###*
  The subject of the report. Usually, but not always, this is a patient. However diagnostic services also perform analyses on specimens collected from a variety of other sources.
  @returns {Reference}
  ###
  subject: -> if @json['subject'] then new Reference(@json['subject'])
  
  ###*
  The diagnostic service that is responsible for issuing the report.
  @returns {Reference}
  ###
  performer: -> if @json['performer'] then new Reference(@json['performer'])
  
  ###*
  The local ID assigned to the report by the order filler, usually by the Information System of the diagnostic service provider.
  @returns {Identifier}
  ###
  identifier: -> if @json['identifier'] then new Identifier(@json['identifier'])
  
  ###*
  Details concerning a test requested.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Reference} objects

        new Reference(item)
  
  ###*
  The section of the diagnostic service that performs the examination e.g. biochemistry, hematology, MRI.
  @returns {CodeableConcept}
  ###
  serviceCategory: -> if @json['serviceCategory'] then new CodeableConcept(@json['serviceCategory'])
  
  ###*
  The time or time-period the observed values are related to. This is usually either the time of the procedure or of specimen collection(s), but very often the source of the date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.
  @returns {Date}
  ###
  diagnosticDateTime: -> if @json['diagnosticDateTime'] then new Date(@json['diagnosticDateTime'])
  ###*
  The time or time-period the observed values are related to. This is usually either the time of the procedure or of specimen collection(s), but very often the source of the date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.

    if @json['specimen']
      for item in @json['specimen']
        new Reference(item)
  
  ###*
  Observations that are part of this diagnostic report. Observations can be simple name/value pairs (e.g. "atomic" results), or they can be grouping observations that include references to other members of the group (e.g. "panels").
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Reference} objects
  ###

    if @json['imagingStudy']
      for item in @json['imagingStudy']
        new Reference(item)
