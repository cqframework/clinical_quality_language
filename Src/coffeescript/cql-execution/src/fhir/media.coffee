require './core'
###*
A photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare. The actual content may be inline or provided by direct reference.
@class Media
@exports Media as Media
###
class Media 
  constructor: (@json) ->
  ###*
  Whether the media is a photo (still image), an audio recording, or a video recording.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link String} objects
  ###
  fhirType:-> @json['fhirType']
  
  ###*
  Details of the type of the media - usually, how it was acquired (what type of device). If images sourced from a DICOM system, are wrapped in a Media resource, then this is the modality.
  @returns {CodeableConcept}
  ###
  subtype: -> if @json['subtype'] then new CodeableConcept(@json['subtype'])
  
  ###*
  Identifiers associated with the image - these may include identifiers for the image itself, identifiers for the context of its collection (e.g. series ids) and context ids such as accession numbers or other workflow identifiers.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Identifier} objects
  ###
  identifier: ->
    if @json['identifier']
      for item in @json['identifier']
        new Identifier(item)
  
  ###*
  When the media was originally recorded. For video and audio, if the length of the recording is not insignificant, this is the end of the recording.
  @returns {Date}
  ###
  dateTime: -> if @json['dateTime'] then new Date(@json['dateTime'])
  
  ###*
  Who/What this Media is a record of.
  @returns {Reference}
  ###
  subject: -> if @json['subject'] then new Reference(@json['subject'])
  
  ###*
  The person who administered the collection of the image.
  @returns {Reference}
  ###
  operator: -> if @json['operator'] then new Reference(@json['operator'])
  
  ###*
  The name of the imaging view e.g Lateral or Antero-posterior (AP).
  @returns {CodeableConcept}
  ###
  view: -> if @json['view'] then new CodeableConcept(@json['view'])
  
  ###*
  The name of the device / manufacturer of the device  that was used to make the recording.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link String} objects
  ###
  deviceName:-> @json['deviceName']
  
  ###*
  Height of the image in pixels(photo/video).
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Number} objects
  ###
  height:-> @json['height']
  
  ###*
  Width of the image in pixels (photo/video).
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Number} objects
  ###
  width:-> @json['width']
  
  ###*
  The number of frames in a photo. This is used with a multi-page fax, or an imaging acquisition context that takes multiple slices in a single image, or an animated gif. If there is more than one frame, this SHALL have a value in order to alert interface software that a multi-frame capable rendering widget is required.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Number} objects
  ###
  frames:-> @json['frames']
  
  ###*
  The length of the recording in seconds - for audio and video.
  @returns {Array} an array of {@link Number} objects
  ###
  length:-> @json['length']
  
  ###*
  The actual content of the media - inline or by direct reference to the media source file.
  @returns {Attachment}
  ###
  content: -> if @json['content'] then new Attachment(@json['content'])
