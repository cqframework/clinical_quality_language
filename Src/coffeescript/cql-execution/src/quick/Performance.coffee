  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  Attribute that specifies the component of a composite action that was performed. For instance, the fulfillment of a prescription may result in both a substance administration event and a dispense event, thus resulting in two actions being performed.

let VancoDoseAdmin =
  [MedicationTreatment, Performance: "Hospital measures-IV Vancomycin"] V 
    where
    dosage[1].route in "Hospital measures-Route IV"
      and IsEquivalent(actionPerformed, DoseAdministrationActionCode)

    if @json['actionPerformed']
      for x in @json['actionPerformed'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The status of an action. It is expected that the range of values for statusCode (i.e., the value set) will vary by the subtypes of Action. For example, Proposal might have one of its status value as Declined.
  ### 
  currentStatus: -> 
    if @json['currentStatus']
      for x in @json['currentStatus'] 
        new QUICK.ActionStatus(x)
       
  ###*
  Identifies a plan that is partly or wholly enacted by the performance of this act
  ###

    if @json['enactsPlan']
      for x in @json['enactsPlan'] 
        new QUICK.StatementOfOccurrence(x)
       
  ###*
  Identifies a proposal that led to this order.

    if @json['fromProposal']
      for x in @json['fromProposal'] 
        new QUICK.StatementOfOccurrence(x)
       
  ###*
  Identifies an order that is partly or wholly filled by the performance of this act

      for x in @json['fulfillsOrder'] 
        new QUICK.StatementOfOccurrence(x)
       
  ###*
  Reason or justification for the action. Reasons may also be specified for not performing an action. 
  ### 
  indication: -> 
    if @json['indication']
      for x in @json['indication'] 
        new QUICK.Indication(x)
       
  ###*
  Preferences are choices made by patients about options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information.

      for x in @json['patientPreference'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The overall time period in which the action is performed. This may be different than the scheduled time or the expected performance time. Time for different activities performed within this action can be specified as subTasks.
  ### 
  performanceTime: -> 
    if @json['performanceTime']
      for x in @json['performanceTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
       
  ###*
  The persons who perform this action, e.g., the person who administered the medication, performed the surgery. 

A performance may have many participants In comparison, an order or a plan has one participant typically. Hence, in performance many participants can be described along with their specific roles.

      for x in @json['performedBy'] 
        new QUICK.Participant(x)
