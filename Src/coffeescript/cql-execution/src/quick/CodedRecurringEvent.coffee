  A code that identifies the occurrence of daily life that determine timing.

This is an example value set with codes taken from http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent:

HS HS event occurs [duration] before the hour of sleep (or trying to).
WAKE WAKE event occurs [duration] after waking.
AC AC event occurs [duration] before a meal (from the Latin ante cibus).
ACM ACM event occurs [duration] before breakfast (from the Latin ante cibus matutinus).
ACD ACD event occurs [duration] before lunch (from the Latin ante cibus diurnus).
ACV ACV event occurs [duration] before dinner (from the Latin ante cibus vespertinus).
PC PC event occurs [duration] after a meal (from the Latin post cibus).
PCM PCM event occurs [duration] after breakfast (from the Latin post cibus matutinus).
PCD PCD event occurs [duration] after lunch (from the Latin post cibus diurnus).
PCV PCV event occurs [duration] after dinner (from the Latin post cibus vespertinus).
