  ###*
  The potential seriousness of a future reaction. This represents a clinical judgment about the worst case scenario for a future reaction. It would be based on the severity of past reactions, the strength of the stimulus (e.g., the dose and route of exposure) that produced past reactions, and the life-threatening or organ system threatening potential of the reaction type.

    if @json['criticality']

        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)

  The time period during which the allergy or intolerance is effective.

    if @json['effectiveTime']
      for x in @json['effectiveTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)

  The possible reactions to the stimulus, e.g., respiratory distress.

  reaction: -> 
    if @json['reaction']
      for x in @json['reaction'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  A code that indicates whether this sensitivity is of an allergic nature or an intolerance to a stimulus.
  ### 
  sensitivityType: -> if @json['sensitivityType'] then new QUICK.CodeableConcept( @json['sensitivityType'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The stimulus that causes the undesirable effect, or when a non-allergy is being specified, the stimulus that does not lead to an undesirable effect.

The stimulus may be a substance (amount of a substance that would not produce a reaction in most individuals) or other agents, e.g., a signal, confined space.

A substance is a physical entity and for purposes of this aspect of the model can mean a drug or biologic, food, chemical agent, plants, animals, plastics etc.
