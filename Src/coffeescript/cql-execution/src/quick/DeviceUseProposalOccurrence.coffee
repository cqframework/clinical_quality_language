Proposal, e.g., by a CDS system, for the specified device to be used.

<b>Example</b>
<u>Expression from source knowledge artifact</u>
Use of CPAP is proposed (for patient with sleep apnea)

<u>Expression in CQL+QUICK</u>
let CPAPProposal =
  [DeviceUse, Proposal: "CPAP"]

###
class DeviceUseProposalOccurrence
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  Details about the clinical statement that were not represented at all or sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.
  ### 
  additionalText: ->  @json['additionalText'] 
 
 
  ###*
  If the application or use of the supply or equipment is repeated, the frequency pattern for repetitions.
  ### 
  applicationSchedule: -> 
    if @json['applicationSchedule']
      for x in @json['applicationSchedule'] 
        new QUICK.Schedule(x)
       
  ###*
  The status of an action. It is expected that the range of values for statusCode (i.e., the value set) will vary by the subtypes of Action. For example, Proposal might have one of its status value as Declined.
  ### 
  currentStatus: -> 
    if @json['currentStatus']
      for x in @json['currentStatus'] 
        new QUICK.ActionStatus(x)
       
  ###*
  The details of the device used or to be used.
  ### 
  device: -> if @json['device'] then new QUICK.Device( @json['device'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The encounter within which the clinical statement was created.
  ### 
  encounter: -> 
    if @json['encounter']
      for x in @json['encounter'] 
        new QUICK.StatementOfOccurrence(x)
       
  ###*
  The time when the action is expected to be performed.
  ### 
  expectedPerformanceTime: -> 
    if @json['expectedPerformanceTime']
      for x in @json['expectedPerformanceTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
       
  ###*
  <font color="#0f0f0f">A unique ID of this clinical statement for reference purposes. It must be provided if user wants it returned as part of any output, otherwise it will be auto-generated, if needed, by CDS system. Does not need to be the actual ID of the source system. </font>
  ### 
  identifier: -> 
    if @json['identifier']
      for x in @json['identifier'] 
        new QUICK.Identifier(x)
       
  ###*
  Reason or justification for the action. Reasons may also be specified for not performing an action. 
  ### 
  indication: -> 
    if @json['indication']
      for x in @json['indication'] 
        new QUICK.Indication(x)
       
  ###*
  The modality of a Clinical Statement describes the way the topic exists, happens, or is experienced.
  ### 
  modality: -> if @json['modality'] then new QUICK.StatementModality( @json['modality'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The mode by which the proposal was received (such as by telephone, electronic, verbal, written). This describes 'how' the communication was done as opposed to dataSourceType which specifies the 'where' and 'from'.
  ### 
  originationMode: -> 
    if @json['originationMode']
      for x in @json['originationMode'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Preferences are choices made by patients about options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information.
  ### 
  patientPreference: -> 
    if @json['patientPreference']
      for x in @json['patientPreference'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The specific condition under which the act being proposed is performed. For example, Pain, Shortness of Breath, Insomnia, Nausea.

If this attribute is specified, it implies that the act must be performed as needed (i.e., is prn).

Reasons such as "SpO2 less than x%" should be addressed as a PRN Instruction rather than a PRN Reason as it is unlikely that a value set can be identified for such range of possible observations.
  ### 
  prnReason: -> 
    if @json['prnReason']
      for x in @json['prnReason'] 
        new QUICK.Indication(x)
       
  ###*
  The identifier of a set of constraints placed on a clinical statement.  If there are multiple templates specified for the element, then the element must satisfy ALL constraints defined in ANY template at that level.
  ### 
  profileId: -> 
    if @json['profileId']
      for x in @json['profileId'] 
        new QUICK.Identifier(x)
       
  ###*
  The time when the proposal was made.
  ### 
  proposedAtTime: ->  @json['proposedAtTime'] 
 
 
  ###*
  Provider preferences are choices made by care providers relative to options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals).
  ### 
  providerPreference: -> 
    if @json['providerPreference']
      for x in @json['providerPreference'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The person who created the statement.

The source and the author of the statement may differ. Statement source is the system from which the statement originated. This may be an EHR or it may be a medical device. 

The statement author is the person creating the statement in the medical record. This may be a person who validates the data from a device, or obtains the history from a subject, a family member, or other source.
  ### 
  statementAuthor: -> 
    if @json['statementAuthor']
      for x in @json['statementAuthor'] 
        new QUICK.Person(x)
       
  ###*
  The time at which the statement was made/recorded. This may not be the same time as the occurrence of the action or the observation event.
  ### 
  statementDateTime: ->  @json['statementDateTime'] 
 
 
  ###*
  The person, device, or other system that was the source of this statement.
  ### 
  statementSource: -> 
    if @json['statementSource']
      for x in @json['statementSource'] 
        new QUICK.Entity(x)
       
  ###*

        new QUICK.ActionStatus(x)

      for x in @json['targetBodySite'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  The subject matter of this clinical statement. The topic may be an action like medication administration, or a finding or other observations about the patient.
  ### 
  topic: -> if @json['topic'] then new QUICK.StatementTopic( @json['topic'] )
 
 
  ###*
  Characterizes how quickly the proposed act must be initiated. Includes concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.
  ### 
  urgency: -> 
    if @json['urgency']
      for x in @json['urgency'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
