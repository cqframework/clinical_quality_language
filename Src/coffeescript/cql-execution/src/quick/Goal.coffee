this.QUICK ||= {}
###*
A defined target or measure to be achieved in the process of patient care; a desired outcome. A typical goal is expressed as a change in status expected at a defined future time.

require './CodeableConcept'
require './Element'

@class Goal
@exports  Goal as Goal
###
class Goal
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  The time that is targeted for the goal to be attained.  For example, there may be a goal to reach a weight of X pounds by a particular date.
  ### 
  goalAchievementTargetTime: -> 
    if @json['goalAchievementTargetTime']
      for x in @json['goalAchievementTargetTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
       
  ###*
  The metric that is the clinical subject of the goal.  Typically a measurable clinical attribute of the subject.  E.g., weight, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c level.
  ### 
  goalFocus: -> if @json['goalFocus'] then new QUICK.CodeableConcept( @json['goalFocus'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The time in which the subject pursues the goal.  This includes pursuing maintenance of a goal that has already been achieved.  
The end time of the interval may be "open" or not stated, if the goal is being indefinitely pursued.  This time is optional, as, for example, one may simply wish to propose weight loss without specifying a pursuit effective time.
  ### 
  goalPursuitEffectiveTime: -> 
    if @json['goalPursuitEffectiveTime']
      for x in @json['goalPursuitEffectiveTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
       
  ###*
  The metric whose achievement would signify the fulfillment of the goal.  E.g., 150 pounds, 7.0%.
  ### 
  goalValue: -> if @json['goalValue'] then new QUICK.Element( @json['goalValue'] )
