  Immobilization device refers to the device or devices used to maximize reproducibility of positioning and to minimize motion of a part of a body for each radiation treatment.   For example, a commonly used immobilization device is a thermoplastic mask for patients being treated to the head and neck region.

  Position defines the way that a patient should be positioned for a given procedure. Examples might include:

- Head: Tilted left or right, neck extended
- Body: Prone, supine, on left/right side
- Arms: Down by side, on chest, above head
- Legs: flat, bent

  The area of the body whose motion is to be managed.
