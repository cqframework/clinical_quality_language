@class ObservationResultGroup
@exports  ObservationResultGroup as quick.ObservationResultGroup
###
class QUICK.ObservationResultGroup
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  Indicates where on the subject's body the observation was made.
  ### 
  bodySite: -> 
    if @json['bodySite']
      for x in @json['bodySite'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  An observation result that is one of the components of the group, e.g., systolic blood pressure, white blood cell count.
  ### 
  component: -> 
    if @json['component']
      for x in @json['component'] 
        new QUICK.ObservationResultBase(x)
       
  ###*
  The assessment made based on the result of the observation.
  ### 
  interpretation: -> 
    if @json['interpretation']
      for x in @json['interpretation'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The technique or mechanism used to perform the observation.
  ### 
  method: -> 
    if @json['method']
      for x in @json['method'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Identifies what type of observation was performed. e.g., body temperature
  ### 
  name: -> if @json['name'] then new QUICK.CodeableConcept( @json['name'] )
 
 
  ###*
  An order placed by a provider that led to this observation result
  ### 
  order: -> 
    if @json['order']
      for x in @json['order'] 
        new QUICK.StatementOfOccurrence(x)
       
  ###*
  Observations related to this observation in some way, e.g., used to derive this observation, previous versions of this observation.

Related observations do not include components. Those are modeled in ObservationResultGroup. 
  ### 
  relatedObservation: -> 
    if @json['relatedObservation']
      for x in @json['relatedObservation'] 
        new QUICK.RelatedObservation(x)
       
  ###*
  An estimate of the degree to which quality issues have impacted on the value reported. e.g., result is ok, measurement still ongoing, results are questionable. Usually, unreliable results are not recorded, but that is not always possible. In such cases, this attribute makes the receiver aware of the quality of the result.
  ### 
  reliability: -> 
    if @json['reliability']
      for x in @json['reliability'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The specimen that was used when this observation was made.
Observations are not made on specimens themselves; they are made on a subject, but usually by the means of a specimen. Note that although specimens are often involved, they are not always tracked and reported explicitly. Also note that observation resources are often used in contexts that track the specimen explicity (e.g. Diagnostic Report).
  ### 
  specimen: -> 
    if @json['specimen']
      for x in @json['specimen'] 
        new QUICK.Specimen(x)
       
  ###*
  The status of the result value. e.g., preliminary, final
  ### 
  status: -> 
    if @json['status']
      for x in @json['status'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Method by which the observation result was validated, e.g., human review, sliding average.
  ### 
  validationMethod: -> 
    if @json['validationMethod']
      for x in @json['validationMethod'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
