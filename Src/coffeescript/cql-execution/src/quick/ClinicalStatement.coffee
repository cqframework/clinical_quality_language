A record of the occurrence (or non-occurrence, or unknown occurrence) of something of clinical relevance. A class that serves as the basis for other more specific clinical statements, such as a statement that an observation has occurred or that a procedure has not been proposed. It is a concrete class that can be specialized as needed.

Note that there are currently three types of clinical statements:

1. A StatementOfOccurrence which indicates that the topic of the statement has or will occur.
2. A StatementOfNonOccurrence which indicates that the topic of the statement has not or will not occur. Note that this statement is different from receiving an empty result set when searching for items of relevance. Given an open-world assumption, not returning results does not necessarily indicate that the event, fact, or action has not been asserted. Rather, a StatementOfNonOccurrence indicates that a person has made an explicit statement that the statement's topic did not occur.
3. A StatementOfUnknownOccurrence which represents an explicit statement that it is not known whether something has or will occur.

  ###*
  Details about the clinical statement that were not represented at all or sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.
  ### 
  additionalText: ->  @json['additionalText'] 
 
 
  ###*
  The encounter within which the clinical statement was created.
  ### 
  encounter: -> 
    if @json['encounter']
      for x in @json['encounter'] 
        new QUICK.StatementOfOccurrence(x)
       
  ###*
  <font color="#0f0f0f">A unique ID of this clinical statement for reference purposes. It must be provided if user wants it returned as part of any output, otherwise it will be auto-generated, if needed, by CDS system. Does not need to be the actual ID of the source system. </font>

  identifier: -> 
    if @json['identifier']

  The modality of a Clinical Statement describes the way the topic exists, happens, or is experienced.
  ### 
  modality: -> if @json['modality'] then new QUICK.StatementModality( @json['modality'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The identifier of a set of constraints placed on a clinical statement.  If there are multiple templates specified for the element, then the element must satisfy ALL constraints defined in ANY template at that level.
  ### 
  profileId: ->

      for x in @json['profileId'] 
        new QUICK.Identifier(x)
       
  ###*
  The person who created the statement.

The source and the author of the statement may differ. Statement source is the system from which the statement originated. This may be an EHR or it may be a medical device. 

The statement author is the person creating the statement in the medical record. This may be a person who validates the data from a device, or obtains the history from a subject, a family member, or other source.

    if @json['statementAuthor']

  ###*
  The time at which the statement was made/recorded. This may not be the same time as the occurrence of the action or the observation event.
  ### 
  statementDateTime: ->  @json['statementDateTime'] 
 
 
  ###*
  The person, device, or other system that was the source of this statement.
  ### 
  statementSource: ->

  ###*
  The patient described by this statement.
  ### 
  subject: -> if @json['subject'] then new QUICK.Patient( @json['subject'] )
