        new QUICK.Schedule(x)
       
  ###*
  The body site used for gaining access to the target body site for the purposes of the substance administration. This is the anatomic site where the substance first enters the body, e.g., left subclavian vein.

  Free text dosage instructions for cases where the instructions are too complex to code.
  ### 
  dosageInstructionsText: ->  @json['dosageInstructionsText'] 
 
 
  ###*
  The amount of the therapeutic or other substance given at one administration event. e.g., 500 mg, 1 tablet, 1 teaspoon
  ### 
  doseQuantity: -> 
    if @json['doseQuantity']
      for x in @json['doseQuantity'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)

    if @json['doseType']
      for x in @json['doseType'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Represents the actual time the substance is infused. Note the difference between infuseOver and duration of treatment (specified in administrationFrequency). An order may call for infusing a patient TID for an hour each time over a duration of 5 days.
  ### 
  infuseOver: -> 
    if @json['infuseOver']
      for x in @json['infuseOver'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  The maximum rate of substance administration. This value may be used as a stopping condition when a deliveryRateIncrement is specified without a count.
  ### 
  maximumDeliveryRate: -> 
    if @json['maximumDeliveryRate']
      for x in @json['maximumDeliveryRate'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  The maximum total quantity of a therapeutic substance that may be administered to a subject over the period of time. E.g. 1000mg in 24 hours.
  ### 
  maximumDosePerPeriod: -> 
    if @json['maximumDosePerPeriod']
      for x in @json['maximumDosePerPeriod'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)

    if @json['maximumVolumeToDeliver']
      for x in @json['maximumVolumeToDeliver'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  A coded value indicating the method by which the substance is introduced into or onto the body. Most commonly used for injections. Examples: Slow Push; Deep IV. Terminologies used often pre-coordinate this term with the route and or form of administration.
  ### 
  method: -> 
    if @json['method']
      for x in @json['method'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The minimum total quantity of a therapeutic substance that may be administered to a subject over the period of time. E.g., 10 mg in 24 hours.
  ### 
  minimumDosePerPeriod: -> 
    if @json['minimumDosePerPeriod']
      for x in @json['minimumDosePerPeriod'] 
        new QUICK.Ratio(x)
       
  ###*
  The speed with which the substance is introduced into the subject. Typically the rate for an infusion. e.g., 200ml in 2 hours.
  ### 
  rate: -> 
    if @json['rate']
      for x in @json['rate'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  The target rate to reach for this infusion.  Note that deliveryRateGoal is typically less than the maximum delivery rate which is the rate not to exceed. For enteral feeding orders, a target tube feeding rate of 75ml/hour may be specified.
  ### 
  rateGoal: -> 
    if @json['rateGoal']
      for x in @json['rateGoal'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  Change in the dosing rate; usually an increase for a patient who is initiating tube feeding. E.g., 20 mL/hour.
  ### 
  rateIncrement: -> 
    if @json['rateIncrement']
      for x in @json['rateIncrement'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  Period of time after which the deliveryRateIncrement should be attempted. E.g., 4 hours.
  ### 
  rateIncrementInterval: -> 
    if @json['rateIncrementInterval']
      for x in @json['rateIncrementInterval'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  The physical route through which the substance is administered. E.g., IV, PO.
  ### 
  route: -> 
    if @json['route']

      for x in @json['targetBodySite'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  Acceptable time for administering the substance. Includes acceptable but suboptimal administration times.  This is an important aspect of immunizations, which have recommended and acceptable/valid timeframes for administration that can differ.
  ### 
  validAdministrationInterval: -> 
    if @json['validAdministrationInterval']
      for x in @json['validAdministrationInterval'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
