Use to record detailed information about conditions, problems or diagnoses recognized by a clinician. There are many uses including: recording a Diagnosis during an Encounter; populating a problem List or a Summary Statement, such as a Discharge Summary.

@class Condition
@exports  Condition as quick.Condition
###
class QUICK.Condition
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  The subject's age when the problem abated.
  ### 
  abatementAge: -> 
    if @json['abatementAge']
      for x in @json['abatementAge'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  A category assigned to the condition. E.g. finding | diagnosis | concern | symptom.
  ### 
  category: -> 
    if @json['category']
      for x in @json['category'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The degree of confidence that this condition is correctly identifed
  ### 
  certainty: -> 
    if @json['certainty']
      for x in @json['certainty'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis. e.g., diabetes mellitus type II, headache.
  ### 
  code: -> if @json['code'] then new QUICK.CodeableConcept( @json['code'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The qualifier allow specifying more details about the condition. e.g., severity, triggering factors, stage.

Qualifiers should not change the meaning of the condition other than making the condition more specific (i.e., they are not modifiers). 
  ### 
  conditionQualifier: -> 
    if @json['conditionQualifier']
      for x in @json['conditionQualifier'] 
        new QUICK.Qualifier(x)
       
  ###*
  Whether the problem was the cause or contributor to the subject's death.
  ### 
  contributionToDeath: -> 
    if @json['contributionToDeath']
      for x in @json['contributionToDeath'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Characterizes impact of condition on life, or durable impact on physiological function or on quality of life. Includes concepts such as life-threatening, or potential loss of function or capacity. E.g., Life threatening, potentially requires hospitalization, self-resolving. Different from severity in that a moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage is likely to be highly important, whereas a moderate headache is not as important.
  ### 
  criticality: -> 
    if @json['criticality']
      for x in @json['criticality'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The time period during which the condition is effective. The represents both the onset date and the date of abatement.
  ### 
  effectiveTime: -> 
    if @json['effectiveTime']
      for x in @json['effectiveTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
       
  ###*
  Indicates the location of the condition on the subject's body.
  ### 
  location: -> 
    if @json['location']
      for x in @json['location'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  The subject's age when the problem began.
  ### 
  onsetAge: -> 
    if @json['onsetAge']
      for x in @json['onsetAge'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  A subjective assessment of the severity of the condition as evaluated by the clinician.
  ### 
  severity: -> 
    if @json['severity']
      for x in @json['severity'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Clinical stage or grade of a condition. May include formal severity assessments.
  ### 
  stage: -> 
    if @json['stage']
      for x in @json['stage'] 
        new QUICK.Stage(x)
       
  ###*
  The state of the condition at the time of the observation, e.g., active, inactive.
