###*
Represents a predictable periodic interval where events may occur at specific points within this interval. Examples may include:

1. An event that may occur TID.
2. An event that may occur TID but at specific times such as 8am, noon, and 3pm.
3. An event that may occur three times a day but the interval is not important.
4. An event that may occur three times a day where the interval between events must be 8hrs (Q8H).

Note that cycles may be nested. For instance, 
A chemotherapy regimen where a substance is administered TID on day 1,5,10 of a 10-day cycle.

  Positive offset between the end of the first cycle and the start of the second one. That is, the start of the next cycle shall start after then end of the previous cycle.

  Negative offset between the end of the previous cycle and the start of the next cycle. That is, the start of the next cycle shall start before the end of the previous cycle.

  Identifies a repeating pattern to the intended time periods such as the number of occurrences in a given time period, the days in a multi-day cycle, or a code representing the frequency of occurrence for a given cycle.

  Point in time when the cycle should end.

  endsOn: -> if @json['endsOn'] then new Period( @json['endsOn'] )

  Number of times to repeat the cycle including the first one. When not specified, assumed to be 1.
