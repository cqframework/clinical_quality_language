###*
Concept representing the likely course of an existing disease or condition or the likelihood (risk) of acquiring a condition that is not currently manifested.

This class represents desirable and undesirable courses.

Examples: 5 year survival, 10-year risk of heart disease, likelihood to recover lower limb neuromuscular function after spinal cord injury
