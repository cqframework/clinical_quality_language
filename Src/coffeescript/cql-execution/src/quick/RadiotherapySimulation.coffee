The type of imaging and any accessories that will be used during a simulation session for radiotherapy.  For example, an order might indicate that the simulation should be done using a 4-dimensional PET-CT with 5mm slices, no bolus and wire (to mark surgical scar).

  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  Defines the thickness of the bolus material to be used. E.g., 5mm thick
  ###

    if @json['bolusThickness']
      for x in @json['bolusThickness'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  Defines the type of tissue-equivalent material that will be placed on a patientâ€™s skin at the time of treatment to minimize the skin-sparing effect of high energy photon beams.  For example, paraffin wax may be used as a bolus.

  bolusType: -> 
    if @json['bolusType']
      for x in @json['bolusType'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Defines the type of marker that will be used to define the targeted area for treatment planning or localize the targeted area during treatment.  For example, gold coils may be placed within a tumor for localization during treatment.

    if @json['markerType']
      for x in @json['markerType'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Defines the distance between each imaging slice. E.g., 5mm between axial slices of a CT scan.

  Additional information pertaining to the simulation
  ### 
  simulationComment: ->  @json['simulationComment'] 
 
 
  ###*
  Defines whether the imaging is volumetric (3D) and whether motion over time will be modeled (4D). E.g., 2D, 3D or 4D
  ### 
  simulationDimensions: -> 
    if @json['simulationDimensions']
      for x in @json['simulationDimensions'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)

  Defines the type of imaging modality to be used. E.g., PET-CT, CT alone, CT-PET, CT-MRI, MRI alone.
