@exports  Proposal as Proposal
###
class Proposal
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  The status of an action. It is expected that the range of values for statusCode (i.e., the value set) will vary by the subtypes of Action. For example, Proposal might have one of its status value as Declined.
  ### 
  currentStatus: -> 
    if @json['currentStatus']
      for x in @json['currentStatus'] 
        new QUICK.ActionStatus(x)
       
  ###*
  The time when the action is expected to be performed.
  ### 
  expectedPerformanceTime: -> 
    if @json['expectedPerformanceTime']
      for x in @json['expectedPerformanceTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
       
  ###*
  Reason or justification for the action. Reasons may also be specified for not performing an action. 
  ### 
  indication: -> 
    if @json['indication']
      for x in @json['indication'] 
        new QUICK.Indication(x)
       
  ###*
  The mode by which the proposal was received (such as by telephone, electronic, verbal, written). This describes 'how' the communication was done as opposed to dataSourceType which specifies the 'where' and 'from'.
  ### 
  originationMode: -> 
    if @json['originationMode']
      for x in @json['originationMode'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Preferences are choices made by patients about options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information.
  ### 
  patientPreference: -> 
    if @json['patientPreference']
      for x in @json['patientPreference'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The specific condition under which the act being proposed is performed. For example, Pain, Shortness of Breath, Insomnia, Nausea.

If this attribute is specified, it implies that the act must be performed as needed (i.e., is prn).

Reasons such as "SpO2 less than x%" should be addressed as a PRN Instruction rather than a PRN Reason as it is unlikely that a value set can be identified for such range of possible observations.
  ### 
  prnReason: -> 
    if @json['prnReason']
      for x in @json['prnReason'] 
        new QUICK.Indication(x)
       
  ###*
  The time when the proposal was made.
  ### 
  proposedAtTime: ->  @json['proposedAtTime'] 
 
 
  ###*
  Provider preferences are choices made by care providers relative to options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals).
  ### 
  providerPreference: -> 
    if @json['providerPreference']
      for x in @json['providerPreference'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The past statuses of this action, e.g., an order may evolve from draft to placed to in progress to completed or canceled.
  ### 
  statusHistory: -> 
    if @json['statusHistory']
      for x in @json['statusHistory'] 
        new QUICK.ActionStatus(x)
       
  ###*
  Characterizes how quickly the proposed act must be initiated. Includes concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.
  ### 
  urgency: -> 
    if @json['urgency']
      for x in @json['urgency'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
