Identifies the timing of a point-in-time occurrence and optionally a sub-cycle in a cycle that starts at a specific point in the cycle and may span a duration of time. 

For instance give a medication on the fifth, 10th, and 18th day of a 24-day cycle for a duration of 1 day each time, three times per day.

  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  If the occurrence has a duration and a frequency, it should be specified as a cycle.

For instance, give medication X on day 5 of a 22 day cycle, three times a day for 2 days.
  ### 
  cycle: -> 
    if @json['cycle']
      for x in @json['cycle'] 
        new QUICK.Cycle(x)
       
  ###*
  The point within the cycle. For instance, for a cycle of 21 days, the 5th day in the cycle is equivalent to a pointInCycle = 5 day (read as Day 5).
  ### 
  pointInCycle: -> if @json['pointInCycle'] then new QUICK.Quantity( @json['pointInCycle'] )
 
 
  ###*
  A code that identifies the occurrence of daily life that determine timing.

This is an example value set with codes taken from http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent:

HS HS event occurs [duration] before the hour of sleep (or trying to).
WAKE WAKE event occurs [duration] after waking.
AC AC event occurs [duration] before a meal (from the Latin ante cibus).
ACM ACM event occurs [duration] before breakfast (from the Latin ante cibus matutinus).
ACD ACD event occurs [duration] before lunch (from the Latin ante cibus diurnus).
ACV ACV event occurs [duration] before dinner (from the Latin ante cibus vespertinus).
PC PC event occurs [duration] after a meal (from the Latin post cibus).
PCM PCM event occurs [duration] after breakfast (from the Latin post cibus matutinus).
PCD PCD event occurs [duration] after lunch (from the Latin post cibus diurnus).
PCV PCV event occurs [duration] after dinner (from the Latin post cibus vespertinus).
