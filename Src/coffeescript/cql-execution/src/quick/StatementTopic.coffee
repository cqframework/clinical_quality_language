The topic of a clinical statement. Generally statement topics fall into two broad categories: (1) statements about things that are observed (e.g., a clinical observation such as elevated blood pressure or a condition such as diabetes) and (2) statements about clinical actions that ought to be, may have been, have been, or will be done (e.g., a proposal for an imaging procedure or the performance of an angioplasty).
