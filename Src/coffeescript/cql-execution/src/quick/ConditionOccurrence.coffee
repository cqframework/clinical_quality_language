###
class QUICK.ConditionOccurrence
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  The subject's age when the problem abated.
  ### 
  abatementAge: -> 
    if @json['abatementAge']
      for x in @json['abatementAge'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  Details about the clinical statement that were not represented at all or sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.
  ### 
  additionalText: ->  @json['additionalText'] 
 
 
  ###*
  A category assigned to the condition. E.g. finding | diagnosis | concern | symptom.
  ### 
  category: -> 
    if @json['category']
      for x in @json['category'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The degree of confidence that this condition is correctly identifed
  ### 
  certainty: -> 
    if @json['certainty']
      for x in @json['certainty'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis. e.g., diabetes mellitus type II, headache.
  ### 
  code: -> if @json['code'] then new QUICK.CodeableConcept( @json['code'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The qualifier allow specifying more details about the condition. e.g., severity, triggering factors, stage.

Qualifiers should not change the meaning of the condition other than making the condition more specific (i.e., they are not modifiers). 
  ### 
  conditionQualifier: -> 
    if @json['conditionQualifier']
      for x in @json['conditionQualifier'] 
        new QUICK.Qualifier(x)
       
  ###*
  Whether the problem was the cause or contributor to the subject's death.
  ###

    if @json['contributionToDeath']
      for x in @json['contributionToDeath'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Characterizes impact of condition on life, or durable impact on physiological function or on quality of life. Includes concepts such as life-threatening, or potential loss of function or capacity. E.g., Life threatening, potentially requires hospitalization, self-resolving. Different from severity in that a moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage is likely to be highly important, whereas a moderate headache is not as important.
  ### 
  criticality: -> 
    if @json['criticality']
      for x in @json['criticality'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The time period during which the condition is effective. The represents both the onset date and the date of abatement.
  ### 
  effectiveTime: -> 
    if @json['effectiveTime']
      for x in @json['effectiveTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)
       
  ###*
  The encounter within which the clinical statement was created.
  ### 
  encounter: -> 
    if @json['encounter']
      for x in @json['encounter'] 
        new QUICK.StatementOfOccurrence(x)
       
  ###*
  <font color="#0f0f0f">A unique ID of this clinical statement for reference purposes. It must be provided if user wants it returned as part of any output, otherwise it will be auto-generated, if needed, by CDS system. Does not need to be the actual ID of the source system. </font>
  ### 
  identifier: -> 
    if @json['identifier']
      for x in @json['identifier'] 
        new QUICK.Identifier(x)
       
  ###*
  Indicates the location of the condition on the subject's body.
  ### 
  location: -> 
    if @json['location']
      for x in @json['location'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  The modality of a Clinical Statement describes the way the topic exists, happens, or is experienced.
  ### 
  modality: -> if @json['modality'] then new QUICK.StatementModality( @json['modality'] )
 
 
  ###*
  Time when the observation was made by the statement author. This may be different than the time the observation was physically recorded (which may occur much later). This also is different time than when the observed phenomenon actually occurred. For example, a patient had a headache three days ago, but reported it to their physician today. The physician would record the observedAtTime as today.
  ### 
  observedAtTime: -> 
    if @json['observedAtTime']
      for x in @json['observedAtTime'] 
        new QUICK.Period(x)

      for x in @json['onsetAge'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*

      for x in @json['profileId'] 
        new QUICK.Identifier(x)
       
  ###*

  ###

  ###*
  Clinical stage or grade of a condition. May include formal severity assessments.
  ###

    if @json['stage']
      for x in @json['stage'] 
        new QUICK.Stage(x)
       
  ###*
  The person who created the statement.

The source and the author of the statement may differ. Statement source is the system from which the statement originated. This may be an EHR or it may be a medical device. 

The statement author is the person creating the statement in the medical record. This may be a person who validates the data from a device, or obtains the history from a subject, a family member, or other source.
  ### 
  statementAuthor: -> 
    if @json['statementAuthor']
      for x in @json['statementAuthor'] 
        new QUICK.Person(x)

(see http://hl7.org/fhir/condition-status for values)
  ### 
  status: ->  @json['status'] 
 
 
  ###*
  The patient described by this statement.
  ### 
  subject: -> if @json['subject'] then new QUICK.Patient( @json['subject'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The subject matter of this clinical statement. The topic may be an action like medication administration, or a finding or other observations about the patient.
  ### 
  topic: -> if @json['topic'] then new QUICK.StatementTopic( @json['topic'] )
