The imaging modality and the frequency with which it will be used to confirm that a tumor/target is in the same position at the time of treatment as it was at the time of simulation are defined.  For example, an order may indicate that a cone-beam CT (CBCT) should be acquired just prior to each treatment to confirm that a lung tumor is within a target volume.
