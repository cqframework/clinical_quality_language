###
class Radiotherapy
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  The body site used for gaining access to the target body site. E.g., femoral artery for a coronary angiography.
  ### 
  approachBodySite: -> 
    if @json['approachBodySite']
      for x in @json['approachBodySite'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  The imaging modality and the frequency will be used to confirm that a tumor/target is in the same position at the time of treatment as it was at the time of simulation are defined.  For example, an order may indicate that a cone-beam CT (CBCT) should be acquired just prior to each treatment to confirm that a lung tumor is within a target volume.
  ### 
  localizationMethod: -> 
    if @json['localizationMethod']
      for x in @json['localizationMethod'] 
        new QUICK.LocalizationMethod(x)
       
  ###*
  The positioning and type of immobilization for various parts of the body are defined.  For example,  an order might indicate that the head should be hyper-extended and immobilized in a head-support and thermoplastic mask.
  ### 
  motionManagement: -> 
    if @json['motionManagement']
      for x in @json['motionManagement'] 
        new QUICK.MotionManagement(x)
       
  ###*
  Percent of the target body site structured of relevance to which the total dose volume applies site (e.g., 60% of the left kidney)
  ### 
  percentageCoveredOfBodySite: -> 
    if @json['percentageCoveredOfBodySite']
      for x in @json['percentageCoveredOfBodySite'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  This is the code that identifies the procedure with as much specificity as available, or as required.  E.g., appendectomy, coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
  ### 
  procedureCode: -> if @json['procedureCode'] then new CodeableConcept( @json['procedureCode'] )
 
 
  ###*
  Describes the method used for the procedure and can vary depending on the procedure.  For example, a surgical procedure method might be laparoscopic surgery or robotic surgery; an imaging procedure such as a chest radiograph might have methods that represent the views such as PA and lateral; a laboratory procedure like urinalysis might have a method of clean catch; a respiratory care procedure such as supplemental oxygen might have a method of nasal cannula, hood, face mask, or non-rebreather mask.
  ### 
  procedureMethod: -> 
    if @json['procedureMethod']
      for x in @json['procedureMethod'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  If the procedure is repeated, the frequency pattern for repetitions.
  ### 
  procedureSchedule: -> 
    if @json['procedureSchedule']
      for x in @json['procedureSchedule'] 
        new QUICK.Schedule(x)
       
  ###*
  The type of imaging and any accessories that will be used during the simulation session are defined.  For example, an order might indicate that the simulation should be done using a 4-dimensional PET-CT with 5mm slices, no bolus and wire (to mark surgical scar).
  ### 
  simulationMethod: -> 
    if @json['simulationMethod']
      for x in @json['simulationMethod'] 
        new QUICK.RadiotherapySimulation(x)
       
  ###*
  The body site where the procedure takes place.  E.g., left lower arm for fracture reduction.
  ### 
  targetBodySite: -> 
    if @json['targetBodySite']
      for x in @json['targetBodySite'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  The radiation delivery techniques to be used for treatment and the physicianâ€™s goals for how much radiation dose targets and normal tissues should receive are defined.  For example, an order might indicate that a treatment should use intensity modulate x-ray radiation (IMXT) to deliver at least 50 Gy to 95% of a planning target volume but no more than 20 Gy to 20% of the total lung volume.

Please note the following guidance vis-a-vis dose:
1. The target volume delineation is captured as the dose's targetBodySite. Values may include: GTV, ITV, CTV and PTV, for instance.
2. doseQuantity may be used to represent 'dose per fraction' - e.g., 2 GY
3. doseRestriction may be used to represent to total dose or the number of fractions for a given volume delineation. Note that this value may specify either a minimum or maximum volume - e.g., 30 GY
  ### 
  treatmentPlanningInstructions: -> 
    if @json['treatmentPlanningInstructions']
      for x in @json['treatmentPlanningInstructions'] 
        new QUICK.Dosage(x)
