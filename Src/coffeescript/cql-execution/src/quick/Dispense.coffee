  This indicates the validity period of a prescription (stale dating the Prescription). It reflects the prescriber perspective for the validity of the prescription. Dispenses must not be made against the prescription outside of this period. The lower-bound of the Dispensing Window signifies the earliest date that the prescription can be filled for the first time. If an upper-bound is not specified then the Prescription is open-ended or will default to a stale-date based on regulations. Rationale: Indicates when the Prescription becomes valid, and when it ceases to be a dispensable Prescription.
