###*
An occurrence of a proposal for an encounter to take place between a patient and a provider, e.g., a proposed referral, a proposed hospitalization.

<b>Example</b>
<u>Expression from source knowledge artifact</u>
Refer patient for a consult to nutrition services for weight loss

<u>Expression in CQL+QUICK</u>
let NutrRef =
  [Encounter, Proposal] E
    where
     serviceType in "Consult"
       and 
     indication[1].reason in "Weight Loss"

  additionalText: ->  @json['additionalText'] 
 
 
  ###*

(see http://hl7.org/fhir/encounter-class for values)
  ### 
  class: ->  @json['class'] 
 
 
  ###*
  The status of an action. It is expected that the range of values for statusCode (i.e., the value set) will vary by the subtypes of Action. For example, Proposal might have one of its status value as Declined.
  ###

  ###*
  <font color="#0f0f0f">A unique ID of this clinical statement for reference purposes. It must be provided if user wants it returned as part of any output, otherwise it will be auto-generated, if needed, by CDS system. Does not need to be the actual ID of the source system. </font>

    if @json['identifier']
      for x in @json['identifier'] 
        new QUICK.Identifier(x)

  ### 
  modality: -> if @json['modality'] then new QUICK.StatementModality( @json['modality'] )
 
 
  ###*
  The mode by which the proposal was received (such as by telephone, electronic, verbal, written). This describes 'how' the communication was done as opposed to dataSourceType which specifies the 'where' and 'from'.
  ### 
  originationMode: -> 
    if @json['originationMode']
      for x in @json['originationMode']

If this attribute is specified, it implies that the act must be performed as needed (i.e., is prn).

Reasons such as "SpO2 less than x%" should be addressed as a PRN Instruction rather than a PRN Reason as it is unlikely that a value set can be identified for such range of possible observations.
  ### 
  prnReason: -> 
    if @json['prnReason']
      for x in @json['prnReason'] 
        new QUICK.Indication(x)
