Unfavorable healthcare event (e.g., death, rash, difficulty breathing, a fall, or an adverse surgical event) that may or may not have been caused by exposure to some agent (e.g., a medication, immunization, food, or environmental agent) or to some action.

An adverse event can range from a mild reaction, such as a harmless rash to a severe and life-threatening condition. They can occur immediately or develop over time. For example, a patient may develop a rash after taking a particular medication. 

Note that allergies are represented as special types of conditions embodied in the AllergyIntolerance class, whereas individual adverse events are represented as adverse events.

Iatrogenic issues should generally be represented as both an adverse event and problem where feasible. For instance, hospital-acquired pneumonia, central-line infections, or deep-venous thrombosis occurring during a hospitalization.

In some cases, the iatrogenic event will be distinct from the resulting problem. For example, an inadvertent liver laceration during surgery is an adverse event whereas the resulting liver bleeding is the problem.
