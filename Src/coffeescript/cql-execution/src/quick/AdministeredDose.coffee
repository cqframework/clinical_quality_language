###
class AdministeredDose
  constructor: (@json) ->
 
  ###*
  The frequency pattern for administration of doses. e.g., three times per day after meals
  ### 
  administrationFrequency: -> 
    if @json['administrationFrequency']
      for x in @json['administrationFrequency'] 
        new QUICK.Schedule(x)
       
  ###*
  The body site used for gaining access to the target body site for the purposes of the substance administration. This is the anatomic site where the substance first enters the body, e.g., left subclavian vein.
  ### 
  approachBodySite: -> 
    if @json['approachBodySite']
      for x in @json['approachBodySite'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
       
  ###*
  How the dose administration was claimed or verified.  E.g., patient-reported, observed by care provider, performed by care provider.  Can be used as a gauge of reliability, or when verified substance administration (e.g., for tuberculosis treatment) is required.
  ### 
  attestationType: -> 
    if @json['attestationType']
      for x in @json['attestationType'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The amount of the therapeutic or other substance given at one administration event. e.g., 500 mg, 1 tablet, 1 teaspoon
  ### 
  doseQuantity: -> 
    if @json['doseQuantity']
      for x in @json['doseQuantity'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  The type of dose.  E.g., initial, maintenance, loading.
  ### 
  doseType: -> 
    if @json['doseType']
      for x in @json['doseType'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  Represents the actual time the substance is infused. Note the difference between infuseOver and duration of treatment (specified in administrationFrequency). An order may call for infusing a patient TID for an hour each time over a duration of 5 days.
  ### 
  infuseOver: -> 
    if @json['infuseOver']
      for x in @json['infuseOver'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  A coded value indicating the method by which the substance is introduced into or onto the body. Most commonly used for injections. Examples: Slow Push; Deep IV. Terminologies used often pre-coordinate this term with the route and or form of administration.
  ### 
  method: -> 
    if @json['method']
      for x in @json['method'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The speed with which the substance is introduced into the subject. Typically the rate for an infusion. e.g., 200ml in 2 hours.
  ### 
  rate: -> 
    if @json['rate']
      for x in @json['rate'] 
        new QUICK.Quantity(x)
       
  ###*
  Change in the dosing rate; usually an increase for a patient who is initiating tube feeding. E.g., 20 mL/hour.
  ### 
  rateIncrement: -> 
    if @json['rateIncrement']
      for x in @json['rateIncrement'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  Period of time after which the deliveryRateIncrement should be attempted. E.g., 4 hours.
  ### 
  rateIncrementInterval: -> 
    if @json['rateIncrementInterval']
      for x in @json['rateIncrementInterval'] 
        new QUICK.Range(x)
       
  ###*
  The physical route through which the substance is administered. E.g., IV, PO.
  ### 
  route: -> 
    if @json['route']
      for x in @json['route'] 
        new QUICK.CodeableConcept(x)
       
  ###*
  The body site where the substance is delivered.
  ### 
  targetBodySite: -> 
    if @json['targetBodySite']
      for x in @json['targetBodySite'] 
        new QUICK.BodySite(x)
