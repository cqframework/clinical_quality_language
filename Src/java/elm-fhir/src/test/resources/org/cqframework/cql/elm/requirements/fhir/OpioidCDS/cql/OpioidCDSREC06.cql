/*
**
**  Recommendation #6
**    Long-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. When opioids
**    are used for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective
**    dose of immediate-release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity
**    than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require
**    opioids. Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days
**    will rarely be needed (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4).
**
**  When
**    Provider is prescribing an opioid analgesic with ambulatory misuse potential in the outpatient setting
**    Opioid review is useful for this patient:
**      Patient is 18 or over
**      Patient does not have findings indicating limited life expectancy
**      Patient does not have orders for therapies indicating end of life care
**      Patient is not undergoing active cancer treatment:
**        Patient has had at least 2 encounters within the past year with any diagnosis of cancer
**    Prescription is for treating acute pain.
**    Prescription is for more than 7 days or for an extended release opioid
**  Then
**    Recommend limiting therapy to no more than 3 days with an absolute maximum of 7 days and limit to immediate release opioids. Potential actions include:
**      Change order to â‰¤ 7 days
**      Document reason for not limiting therapy; snooze 3 months
**      N/A - see comment; snooze 3 months
