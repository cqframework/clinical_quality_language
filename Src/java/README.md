# Overview

This is a multi-module project for CQL Kotlin and Java libraries and tooling applications.
It contains the following sub-projects:

* **cql:** generates and builds Kotlin lexers, parsers, listeners, and visitors using the CQL ANTLR4 grammar; generates and builds Kotlin classes based on the ELM Model Info schema and CQL base type system
* **elm:** generates and builds Kotlin classes based on the ELM XML schema
* **shared:** contains shared classes used by other modules
* **elm-fhir:** contains data requirements processor and FHIR-related utilities
* **engine:** contains the ELM runtime (aka "CQL engine")
* **engine-fhir:** contains FHIR-related components for the ELM runtime
* **qdm:** contains schema and model info resources for QDM
* **quick:** contains schema and model info resources for QUICK, FHIR, QI-Core, US Core, as well as the FHIRHelpers library
* **cql-to-elm:** generates Expression Logical Model (ELM) XML and JSON from CQL source
* **cql-to-elm-cli:** provides command-line access to the CQL-to-ELM translator
* **ucum:** provides the default UCUM service
* **tools:cql-formatter:** formats input CQL based on standard formatting conventions as suggested by the CQL specification
* **tools:cql-parsetree:** provides simple command-line access to the debug information for a CQL parse tree
* **tools:xsd-to-modelinfo:** generates model info given an XML Schema (XSD) as input


# Building the Project

This project uses the [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) build system.  A gradle wrapper, which automatically downloads
and uses an instance of gradle, is provided for convenience.  To build the project, install the [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17), clone this
repository, then execute this command from within this directory:

    ./gradlew build

This will generate and build the ANTLR4 CQL artifacts and the XSD-based ELM library and model info artifacts.
It will also build and test the corresponding code libraries and applications.

To clean up the build artifacts:

    ./gradlew clean

# Executing the Sample Code

You can execute the sample code using the `gradlew` command or a script generated by gradle.

To execute the sample code using `gradlew`, you must execute the `run` command, using the project-specific
path.  The following are current possibilities:

    ./gradlew :cql:run
    ./gradlew :cql-to-elm-cli:run
    ./gradlew :tools:cql-parsetree:run

To execute the sample code using a script generated by gradle, first generate the scripts:

    ./gradlew installDist

Then execute the generated script (optionally passing in an argument).  The following example executes
the sample cql code with the path to a CQL file as an argument:

    ./cql/build/install/cql/bin/cql ../../Examples/CMS135_QDM.cql

You can also execute the cql-parsetree tool in a similar way:

    ./tools/cql-parsetree/build/install/cql-parsetree/bin/cql-parsetree ../../Examples/CMS135_QDM.cql

## Generate an ELM Representation of CQL Logic

To generate an ELM representation of CQL logic, build and execute the cql-to-elm app:

    ./gradlew :cql-to-elm-cli:installDist
    ./cql-to-elm-cli/build/install/cql-to-elm-cli/bin/cql-to-elm-cli --input ../../Examples/CMS135_QDM.cql

The following options are supported:

* `--input` or `-i`: Specify the input CQL file (REQUIRED).
* `--output` or `-o`: Specify the output file.  If not specified, the output file will have the
  same base name and location as the input file.  If only a directory is specified, the output
  file will have the same base name as the input file and be written to the requested directory.
* `--format` or `-f`: Output as `XML` (default), `JSON`, or `COFFEE`.
* _[more...](cql-to-elm/OVERVIEW.md)_

For a complete list of supported options as well as more information on the CQL-to-ELM translator, refer to the [Overview](cql-to-elm/OVERVIEW.md) for that project.
