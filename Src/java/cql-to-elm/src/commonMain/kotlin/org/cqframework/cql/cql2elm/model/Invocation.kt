/**
 * The Invocation interface is used to represent an invocation of an operator or function in the ELM
 * model. The ELM classes have named properties for their operands, but the Invocation interface
 * uses a list of expressions to represent the operands. The implementations of this interface are
 * responsible for managing the mapping between the list of expressions and the properties of the
 * ELM class. For example, the DateInvocation class maps properties for year, month, and day to the
 * first, second, and third expressions in the list of operands. This allows Invocations to be
 * handled generically in the CQL-to-ELM translation process.
