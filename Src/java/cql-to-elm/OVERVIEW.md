# CQL-to-ELM Translator Reference Implementation

The reference implementation for translation of CQL libraries to ELM-based XML documents is currently under development. The reference implementation is intended to be used in CQF pilots, as well as to provide a tool to enable CQL output to be uniformly and automatically translated into ELM-based XML documents for sharing and distribution to support implementation, integration, translation, and execution of CQL-based artifacts.

The CQL-to-ELM Translator is licensed under the open source [Apache Version 2.0](../../../LICENSE) license, and available as part of the [clinical_quality_language](https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language) project on GitHub.

## Technologies

CQL is defined using an [ANTLR4](http://www.antlr.org/) grammar. ANTLR4 is a simple language for describing language grammars and automatically generating the lexical analysis and parsing components for the resulting grammar. The CQL-to-ELM translator uses the visitor classes generated by ANTLR4 to perform the translation processing.

## Approach

TODO

## Current Status

The CQL-to-ELM Translator, although still under development, is fairly complete. All language constructs expressible within CQL are transformed to the equivalent ELM, with the exception of included libraries.
