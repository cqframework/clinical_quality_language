Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians might not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term &quot;allergy&quot; is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of &quot;intolerance&quot; - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts might not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance.

Some codes such as BID are ubiquitous, but many institutions define their own additional codes. If a code is provided, the code is understood to be a complete statement of whatever is specified in the structured timing data, and either the code or the data may be used to interpret the Timing, with the exception that .repeat.bounds still applies over the code (and is not contained in the code)." comment="BID etc. are defined as 'at institutionally specified times'. For example, an institution may choose that BID is &quot;always at 7am and 6pm&quot;.  If it is inappropriate for this choice to be made, the code BID should not be used. Instead, a distinct organization-specific code should be used in place of the HL7-defined BID code and/or a structured representation should be used (in this case, specifying the two event times).">
