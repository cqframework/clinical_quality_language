/**
 * Created by Bryn on 8/22/2016.
 *
 * Profiles within CQL allow the same underlying type to be accessed using different labels. When a
 * profile is referenced, the ELM retrieve that is output will use the baseType of the profile as
 * the dataType, and the name of the profile as the identifier. This allows the implementation to
 * detect when the same data type has been accessed in a different way by the author.
 *
 * This mechanism is used in QDM to enable the negation pattern. For example, the Encounter,
 * Performed data type is the same whether it is accessed positively or negatively, but the
 * difference needs to be communicated reliably through the data access layer, so profiles are used,
 * one positive and one negative. The underlying type Encounter, Performed, is not retrievable, only
 * the positive and negative profiles. The identifiers are set to Encounter, Performed, and
 * Encounter, Not Performed, and the resulting retrieve will reflect the EncounterPerformed type,
 * together with the name of the profile, PositiveEncounterPerformed or NegativeEncounterPerformed,
 * depending on which profile was used in the retrieve.
 *
 * NOTE: This behavior was subsequently changed due to the inconsistency it introduces between
 * retrieves and general-purpose expressions. QDM still defines a base type with profiles for
 * positive and negative aspects, but the retrieve will now return the profile type, not the base
 * type. See GitHub issue #131 for a detailed discussion of this change.
