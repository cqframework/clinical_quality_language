The Clinical Quality Language (CQL) specification defines a representation for the
expression of clinical knowledge that can be used within both the Clinical
Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Measurement (CQM) domains.

This repository contains the CQL grammar file, ELM UML / schemas, examples, and
proof-of-concept code for working with CQL.
